My Garage Ver 1.0 - JavaScript
==============================

The "you" in a parallel dimension is super rich and has a huge garage. This version of you has decided to start filling said garage with cars that you have had throughout your life. This alternate you wants to be able to input the year, make, model, a URL of a picture of the car, and description. Then have the cars in the garage displayed on the DOM. We'll also add some rudimentary CSS for basic styling.

We'll be storing a number "car" objects in a "garage" array.

The Car Object
--------------
* year
* make
* model
* picURL
* description

0.1 - basic page with JS and CSS
0.2 - enable user input
0.3 - create car object
0.4 - add car object to array
0.5 - list array info on DOM
0.6 - update output styling on DOM
0.7-1.0 - update your styling and consider what else can be done with this. Have some fun with it!

A few possible things you could consider:
* the look of the input fields (maybe look into using a form? Sounds like an interesting idea)
* styling/look of the page overall
* display the info for the cars differently
* show how many cars are in the garage
* only 1 car showed at a time with "next"/"previous" buttons that carousel through the cars in the garage

Even if you don't know how to do any of these atm, consider how you think they COULD be accomplished. If you are feeling industrious, you could do a little research and give it a shot! Break off a branch in which to experiment and don't hesitate to try new things.
