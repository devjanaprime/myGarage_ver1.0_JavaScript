My Garage Ver 1.0 - JavaScript
==============================

The "you" in a parallel dimension is super rich and has a huge garage. This version of you has decided to start filling said garage with cars that you have had throughout your life. This alternate you wants to be able to input the year, make, model, a URL of a picture of the car, and description. Then have the cars in the garage displayed on the DOM. We'll also add some rudimentary CSS for basic styling.

We'll be storing a number "car" objects in a "garage" array.
